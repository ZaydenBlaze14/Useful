## Setting up Windows

#

I will assume you have an installed windows 11 Home or Pro, with your desired partitions laid out. There isnt anything to tweak in those.

We will be using [Hibit Portable](http://www.hibitsoft.ir/Uninstaller.html)

  - ### Nvidia

    - Use NVCleanInstall
    - Manually select driver version, choose your preferred driver version and platform

      > For laptops

    - If you want geforce experience/shadowplay select he modules or download your drivers from the official website

    - Some laptops require the usb-c module for the optimus to work, Turing and above.

    - These remove the bloat that is installed with nvidia drivers and the background services

  - ### AMD/Intel

    - I haven't have had any device from AMD but the general consensus is to use the official installer

    - Intel Update Assistant is preferred. Install it, upgrade your drivers and uninstall it

**Most other drivers will be installed by windows update, unless you have a specific hardware of which you have to do your own research**
