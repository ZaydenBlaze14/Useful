# Some stuff I found for linux

I primarily use WSL2 for my development work, with the occasional VM with Linux Mint.

### [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)

     Much faster than BASH or ZSH
     Less plugin support but bfaster plugins

### Slow ZSH

    Using NVM with zsh slows down the prompt of the shell, there are various guides to fix this, precaching and such but none of them worked for me
    Switching to FISH shell was a decent enough workaround

### [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

    Plugin Downloader/Manager for FISH

### [Starship](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation)

    My most favourite theme for any shell

### [Nala](https://gitlab.com/volian/nala)

    A frontend alternative to APT in Ubuntu/Debian derivatives
    Supports parallel downloads and ranking of mirrors

### [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

    A version manager like NVM for python versions
    Supports virtual environments
