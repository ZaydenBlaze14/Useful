## _Useful Stuff that I found online_
---

I like to keep a consolidated lists of programs, tricks and such. These are most of them. Which I can remember anyway. 

I will update this list whenever I have free time. All the stuff in here has been used by me and have encounter almost none amount of problems.

Still be careful out on the internet. 

Most of these are free or open-source
