## _Useful Stuff that I found online_
---

I like to keep a consolidated lists of programs, tricks and such. These are most of them. Which I can remember anyway. 

I will update this list whenever I have free time. All the stuff in here has been used by me and have encounter almost none amount of problems.

> Still be careful out on the internet. 

Most of these are free or open-source 

You can use these guides for setting up a new or an old installations of windows, I do not believe in running random scripts on my personal computer hence there won't be any links to any scripts that "makes your pc faster".

> I also use a microsoft account as it is used in my way of work so no privacy focused tweaks, for that you will have to do your own research. 

That being said understand each step and proceed cautiously especially the hardware manipulation part. As this is a written guide, read all the steps before starting to do anything.

All the links of the softwares used are in the softwares page
